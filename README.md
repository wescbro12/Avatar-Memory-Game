# Avatar-Memory-Game
This is a simple memory game using the character's from Avatar- The last Airbender.
The computer randomizes the cards and the player will have to click each card to "flip" it over to see if they have a match. If the player does not have a match then the cards will return to their "starting" state. If the player does get a match then the cards will disapper from the playing deck. The player will win if they are able to get all of the cards matched.
